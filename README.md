# AB_Testing
Suggest e-commerce on the design of pages and help them make better decisions using AB Testing
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these 

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# Conclusion
>Although it would seem from the outset that there is a difference between the conversion rates of new and old pages, there is just not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. From the histogram shown in this report, it seems that the new page does worse than the old pages.

>It was also found that this was not dependent on countries. The test conditions were fairly good as well, users had a roughly 50% chance to recieve the new and old pages and the sample size of the initial dataframe is sufficiently big such that collecting data is likely not a good use of resources.

>I would recommend that the e-commerce company spend their money on trying to improve their website before trying again. And look for better design of page
